README.ASC

Welcome to the programs included in the OS/2 2.1 Application
Programmer's Guide, by Kelly, Swearingen, Bezviner, and
Shrader.

We have set up a directory for each chapter that contains
complete programs.  The directory name corresponds with
the short name of the chapter in the book, such as CH1, CH9,
CH17, and so on.

Four chapters do not contain any complete programs and,
therefore, no directory is included on this diskette.  These
are Chapters 2, 3, 17, and 20.

In each directory, we have included the makefiles necessary
for running the programs.

We have compiled, tested, and run these programs and believe
them to be accurate.  However, we offer them "as is" and
provide neither guarantees nor support.

This code is also covered by the same copyright in effect
for the book, so we suggest that you tweak everything to
make the code your own if you choose to cut and paste.
