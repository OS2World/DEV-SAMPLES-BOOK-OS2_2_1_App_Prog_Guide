The four objects created by the SOM runtime are:
     1. The SOMObject class object: 
        {An instance of class SOMClass at address 00220090}

   2. The SOMClass class object: 
        {An instance of class SOMClass at address 00220110}

   3. The SOMClassMgr class object: 
        {An instance of class SOMClass at address 00224010}

   4. The SOMClassMgr object: 
        {An instance of class SOMClassMgr at address 00224950}


The three calculator-related class objects are:

   5. For the "calculator" class:  
        {An instance of class M_calculator at address 00224D90}

   6. For the "fcalc" class:  
        {An instance of class M_calculator at address 00228090}

   7. For the "dumbcalc" class:  
        {An instance of class M_calculator at address 00228410}



They are descended from the following classes:

   8. For the "calculator" class:  
         The M_calculator class's parent is the SOMClass class

   9. For the "fcalc" class:     
         The M_calculator class's parent is the SOMClass class

   10. For the "dumbcalc" class:  
         The M_calculator class's parent is the SOMClass class


The three calculator objects are:

calc1:    {An instance of class calculator at address 002286B0}
          The calculator class's parent is the SOMObject class

calc2:  {An instance of class fcalc at address 002286D0}
          The fcalc class's parent is the calculator class

calc3:  {An instance of class dumbcalc at address 002286F0}
          The dumbcalc class's parent is the fcalc class
